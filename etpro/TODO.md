# Todo list for ETPro container

 * Rewrite `start` in bash so that PHP is no longer a depencency.
 * Use something smaller than `FROM ubuntu`, it's not ideal.
 * If `MAPS` is undefined, it still tries to download a map with no name.
 * Extra configuration options:
   * ETTV Password.
   * Slots/ETTV slots.
 * Add extra configs, such as speedcup and baserace.
 * Remove nonsense from `et.tar` such as Punkbuster.
